# Junior Developer Roadmap - 2020 [WIP]

![Warning](./warning.jpg) - This guide is work in progress.

This is a language, frameworks and library agnostic solid ultimate guide to Become a Junior Developer. but one thing is clear - this is my own thought and experience. you may found thousands of videos, articles, blog posts and developer guidelines handbook. most of them are same and a few of them are good enough. you can search and see them all or a few of them. I will lead you to go through a solid path and recommends well known courses to learn the specific topics.

This guide I have created to help my fellow students and developer friends. Ha ha ... :) I am not a professional teacher or instructor anymore. I just try to share my own experience and learning to a limited amount of learners via online and its totally free of cost.

You can ask me anything by writing [here]() or shoot me an email: [jamal.pb95@gmail.com](mailto:jamal.pb95@gmail.com).
